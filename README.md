# Eternum_Bioinformatics
An open bioinformatics research framework connecting **ALS**, **Mycelium**, and **the Cosmos** through shared chemical & electrical signaling. This project features a *Trinity Engine* (Neuroplasticity • Mycelium Rerouting • Cosmic Entropy) and a **Blockchain Neuroplasticity** ledger (the *Eternum Liquidity Nexus*).

## Goals
- Explore parallels in signaling across neurons, mycelial networks, and cosmic phenomena.
- Develop models to simulate regenerative neuroplasticity inspired by fungal networks.
- Integrate a regenerative finance layer to support open research and clinical translation.

## Repository Structure
- **src/**: Core Python modules for signal analysis, neuroplasticity modeling, and blockchain interfacing.
- **docs/**: Project documentation and detailed technical references.
- **data/**: Placeholder for processed signals and future datasets.
- **notebooks/**: Interactive Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis and prototyping.
