# Eternum Bioinformatics ðŸŒ±ðŸ§ âœ¨

**ALS â€¢ Mycelium â€¢ Cosmos**  
Exploring the parallels of **chemical & electrical signaling** across fungal, neural, and cosmic systems â€” and embedding those insights into a **Blockchain Neuroplasticity Ledger** (the Eternum Liquidity Nexus).

## ðŸš€ Vision

- **ALS as Miscommunication** â€” not only degeneration, but rerouting failures in chemical & electrical impulse networks.  
- **Mycelium as Teacher** â€” fungal networks reroute, self-heal, and redistribute signals/nutrients with resilience.  
- **Cosmos as Mirror** â€” stars and entropy cycles encode regenerative patterns beyond biological scale.  
- **Blockchain Neuroplasticity** â€” an adaptive, transparent ledger to fund and log regenerative research.  

Together, these form the **Trinity Engine**:  
ðŸŒ± *Mycelium AI* â€¢ ðŸ§  *Brain AI* â€¢ âœ¨ *Stars AI*
